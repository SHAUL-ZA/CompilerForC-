# CompilerForC-


This is a compiler for the **C-** language, developed as an academic project. The compiler currently supports the following phases:

- **Lexer (Lexical Analysis)**
- **Parser (Syntax Analysis)**
- **Semantic Analyzer**

## ðŸ”§ Project Structure

 ```
cminus-compiler/
â”œâ”€â”€ lexer/ # Lexical analysis: token generation
â”œâ”€â”€ parser/ # Syntax analysis: AST construction
â”œâ”€â”€ semantic/ # Semantic analysis: type checking and symbol verification
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md

``` 

## Implemented Features

### Lexer
- Recognition of identifiers, keywords, operators, and literals.

- Basic lexical error handling.

### Parser
- Construction of abstract syntax trees (AST).

- Support for C- language constructs like functions, conditionals, and loops.

### Semantic Analyzer
- Type checking.

- Variable declaration and usage validation.

- Symbol table management.
